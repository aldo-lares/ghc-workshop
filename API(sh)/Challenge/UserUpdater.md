Description
Add an endpoint that updates a user's information (name, email, etc.). This challenge will help you practice data updating and response handling in APIs.

Expectation:

Implement an API endpoint /update-user/:id.

The endpoint should accept user data (name, email, etc.) and update the user information.

The endpoint should return a confirmation message or error if the user ID is not found.

Ensure the API is properly documented and easy to test.
