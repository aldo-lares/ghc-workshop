Description
Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward). This challenge helps you practice string manipulation and comparison.

Expectation:

Define a function that takes a string as an argument.

The function should return true if the string is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Consider edge cases such as empty strings or case sensitivity.
