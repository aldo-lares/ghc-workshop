ðŸª™ Fizz Buzz
Level of Difficulty: ðŸª™
Description
Print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz." For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz." This classic problem is a great way to practice control structures like loops and conditionals.

Expectation:

Create a loop that iterates from 1 to 100.

Use conditional statements to check if the number is a multiple of 3, 5, or both.

Print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
